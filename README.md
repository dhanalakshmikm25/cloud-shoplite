# 🌩️ CloudShop Lite — AI-Augmented Cloud-Native Microservices Platform

CloudShop Lite is a production-style cloud-native e-commerce platform deployed on **AWS EKS Kubernetes** and enhanced with an **AI-powered Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) assistant**.

The system demonstrates how Large Language Models can operate infrastructure — diagnosing failures, analyzing logs, and executing recovery actions — through a dual-agent architecture:

- **In-cluster AI-Ops bot** → monitors & heals Kubernetes workloads
- **Host-level MCP agent** → performs system-level investigation & operations

This transforms a traditional microservices demo into a **self-healing intelligent cloud platform**.
